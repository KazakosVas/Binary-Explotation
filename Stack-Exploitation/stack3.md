Our goal is to solve this explotation challenge <i> [Stack3](https://exploit.education/protostar/stack-three/)</i>

# Code to exploit 
```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void win()
{
  printf("code flow successfully changed\n");
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int (*fp)();
  char buffer[64];

  fp = 0;

  gets(buffer);

  if(fp) {
      printf("calling function pointer, jumping to 0x%08x\n", fp);
      fp();
  }
}

```

In this code we have a function-pointer in stack, which will be called if its value 
is different than zero.
